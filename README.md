About this version
------------------

This is a community driven fork of swiftmailer, as official support has been [ended in November 2021](https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-swiftmailer).

**Do not use it for new projects, [the newer Symfony Mailer Compontent](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) is the way to go today.**

ðŸŽ¯ The main purpose of this fork
--------------------------------

To support same PHP versions as latest version of [FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1).


Swift Mailer
------------

**Swiftmailer will stop being maintained at the end of November 2021.**

Please, move to [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) at your earliest convenience.
[Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) is the next evolution of Swiftmailer.
It provides the same features with support for modern PHP code and support for third-party providers.

Swift Mailer is a component based mailing solution for PHP.
It is released under the MIT license.

Swift Mailer is highly object-oriented by design and lends itself
to use in complex web application with a great deal of flexibility.

For full details on usage, read the [documentation](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html).
